# 🎮 Villagers, Knights & Dragon

A social deduction party game built with FastAPI, HTMX, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. Inspired by the classic "Mr. White" game, players must work together to identify the Dragon among them!

## 🎯 Game Overview

**Villagers, Knights & Dragon** is a real-time multiplayer social deduction game where players are assigned secret roles:
- **Villagers**: Know the secret word and must identify the Dragon
- **Knights**: Know a similar (but different) word and must identify the Dragon. Knights don't know they are knights - they think they are villagers!
- **Dragon**: Doesn't know the word and must blend in to survive

### How to Play

1. **Create Game**: Host creates a new game and receives a unique shareable link
2. **Invite Players**: Share the link with 2-11 friends (3-12 players total)
3. **Join Lobby**: Players enter their nicknames to join the game
4. **Start Game**: Host starts when everyone has joined
5. **Roles Assigned**: Each player sees their role and word (Dragon sees "???")
6. **Discussion Phase**: Players discuss to figure out who the Dragon is
7. **Voting Phase**: Host initiates voting, everyone votes to eliminate a player
8. **Win Conditions**:
   - **Villagers/Knights win** if they eliminate the Dragon
   - **Dragon wins** if they survive until ≤2 players remain OR correctly guess the word after elimination
